# Connected

This document "connects" homestuck to several other medias. The connections should be specific and sufficiently (strong or surprising).

For example, Sans is in Super Smash Bros Ultimate, but that doesn't really count as the connection is not specific enough (the same connection could be used for multiple things).

Another example is strawberry cake. Strawberry cake is soo good. No wonder it is used soo often. (Portal, SM64, Celeste, To the Stars)

## Dweller's Empty Path

1. Undertale --> Homestuck
2. Deltarune --> Undertale
3. Dweller's Empty Path --> Deltarune

Probably the least suprising connection

## Among us

1. Homestuck --> Ace Attorney
2. Among us <--> Ace Attorney (through fanon: <https://www.youtu.be/5zs8YnbimZY>)
