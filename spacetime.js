// The theory of relativity relates space and time together.
// However, Homestuck breaks the laws of physics, which aren't laws so much as rules
// that get less stable the further out you go from a universe.

// For simplicity, let's have space and time can be separate properties.
// Since time of one universe is independent from another, this is convenient.

// Additionally, JavaScript only allows datetimes within 100 million seconds of 1970-1-1.
// But since there are events that happened, say, 413 million years ago, there will need to be a workaround.

// And finally, how are universes named? When does a character hear of a different universe's existence or its name?
// Universe > Name > Fact > Timeline point > Universe
//
// There is a recursive structure...
